# Kubernetes HA on Google Compute Engine
The repo contains actions and Terraform code to provision 3 control plane nodes in 3 zones, a VPC, a Load Balancer and the required Health checks and firewall rule.


## Used Components and Tools

 * Terraform - for automated resources provisioning in gce
 * GitHub Actions 

## Preparation
### Create GitHub repository

Create new repository on GitHub [manually](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)
or using [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create).


### Get your gce credentials
You need a Service Account with the appropriate permissions for Terraform to create the infrastructure.

Use `gcloud` CLI tool to create these credentials.

```bash
export GCLOUD_PROJECT="GCP_PROJECT_ID"
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="SAME_AS_SSH_USERNAME" 
# create new service account
gcloud iam service-accounts create "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}"
# get your service account id
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter="name:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" --format='value(email)')
# create policy bindings for KKP
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${GCLOUD_PROJECT}" --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID}" --role='roles/compute.admin'
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${GCLOUD_PROJECT}" --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID}" --role='roles/iam.serviceAccountUser'
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${GCLOUD_PROJECT}" --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID}" --role='roles/viewer'
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${GCLOUD_PROJECT}" --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID}" --role='roles/storage.admin'
# create policy bindings for Google GitHub actions
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID} --member="serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID}" --role='roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator'
# create a new json key for your service account
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create --iam-account "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID}" "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}-sa-key.json"
# export JSON file content of created service account json key
export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=$(cat "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}-sa-key.json")
```

See [KubeOne documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/master/architecture/requirements/machine_controller/google_cloud/gcp/) for more details.

### Generate SSH keys

SSH public/private key-pair is used for accessing the master cluster nodes. You can generate these keys locally, or use the keys generated by `gcloud` console located in `~/.ssh/`directory.

Both keys will need to set them inside the secret management below.

You can use following command to generate the keys:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} -f k8s_rsa
```

You will need the content of private/public SSH key in the next steps, pipeline will use it for accessing the nodes.
### Setup GitHub Secrets for the GitHub Workflow pipeline

Go to your GitHub repository under "Settings" -> "Secrets" and setup following secrets:
 * `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` with value of your Google Service Account (see above)
 * `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` with value of private SSH key (e.g. content of `k8s_rsa`)
 * `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` with value of public SSH key (e.g. content of `k8s_rsa.pub`)

### Push Content to your Git repository

```bash
git init
git checkout -b main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup for KKP on Autopilot"
git remote add origin git@github.com:<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPOSITORY>
git push -u origin main
```

### Validation
Check the steps of the GitHub Actions after first merge to `main` branch and enjoy the full deployment of KKP at the end!

## High-level Pipeline Design

*tf-validate*
* runs validation of all Terraform modules

*tf-prepare*
* prepare Terraform backend for storing state

*tf-plan*
* prepare Terraform plan based on the stored state
* Terraform state is stored on AWS S3 bucket (created in previous step)

*tf-apply*
* applies the Terraform changes based on a plan (from previous stage)
* runs only on `main` branch
==> VMs, network and LB for k8s on AWS is prepared at this stage
